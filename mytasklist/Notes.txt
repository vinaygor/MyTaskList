Firstly install all the dependencies using node package manager.

Command:

npm install express body-parser ejs mongojs --save

This will create package.json with all the dependencies required.

------------ To start the server use following command-----------------

node server

Once started you can check by going to URL--> localhost:3000 (3000 is the port number defined in package.json)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
After we make any changes we need to restart the server. This can be automated by installing "nodemon"

command:
npm install -g nodemon

Once the installation is done we will now run nodemon instead of node server
